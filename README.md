# Pomerium for Kubernetes

Use Pomerium as a first-class secure-by-default Ingress Controller. The Pomerium Ingress Controller enables workflows more native to Kubernetes environments, such as Git-Ops style actions based on pull requests. Dynamically provision routes from Ingress resources and set policy based on annotations. By defining routes as Ingress resources you can independently create and remove them from Pomerium's configuration.
